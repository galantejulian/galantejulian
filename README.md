 My goal is to learn the necessary skills to succeed in the future, that will be necessarily linked to 
 programming. I have multicultural work experience in several countries, I am fluent in both English 
 and Spanish and have a great capacity for adaptation and teamwork.

 I am looking for a job as a developer, that will allow me to continue developing myself in the field while at the same time helping to solve concrete problems of    modern society.
